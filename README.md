# 🖥️ System Utilities Project

*A collection of simple yet powerful tools built with Linux & Shell scripting to make everyday DevOps tasks easier.*

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **User Login Tracker**

* Tracks every login session.
* Logs details like **username, timestamp, and source IP**.
* Helps with auditing and security checks.

### 2. **Resource Management Tracker**

* Monitors **CPU, memory, and disk usage**.
* Prevents overload by highlighting high usage.
* Can be scheduled to run at intervals for continuous tracking.

### 3. **Automatic Backup System**

* Creates regular backups of system logs.
* Stores them neatly in a **separate folder** with timestamps.
* Ensures no important data is ever lost.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian based)**
* **Shell Scripting (Bash)**
* Cron Jobs (for automation)

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-utilities.git
cd system-utilities
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Run Scripts

#### 1️⃣ User Login Tracker

```bash
./login-tracker.sh
```

📌 Saves login info in `logs/login.log`.

#### 2️⃣ Resource Management Tracker

```bash
./resource-tracker.sh
```

📌 Outputs resource usage in `logs/resource.log`.

#### 3️⃣ Automatic Backup System

```bash
./auto-backup.sh
```

📌 Creates backups in the `backups/` folder.

## ⏰ Automation with Cron Jobs

To run scripts automatically, add them to cron:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Example: Run backup every day at midnight

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/auto-backup.sh
```

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add email/SMS alerts for abnormal usage.
* Create a dashboard to visualize logs.
* Support multiple servers in one place.

## 💡 Takeaway

This project proves that even **basic Linux & shell scripting** can handle important tasks like:
✔️ Tracking users
✔️ Monitoring resources
✔️ Automating backups

Sometimes, **small scripts create big solutions**. 🚀
