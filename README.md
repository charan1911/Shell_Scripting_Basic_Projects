# 🐚 Shell Scripting Basic Projects  

A collection of **basic Linux shell scripting projects** designed to automate repetitive tasks, track usage, and improve system reliability.  
This repo is a great starting point for anyone exploring **Linux, automation, and DevOps fundamentals**.  

---

## ✨ Projects Included  

### 🔹 1. User Login Tracker (ULT.sh)  
- Records **who logged in, when, and from where**.  
- Saves details into `ult_logs.txt` for auditing and security.  

### 🔹 2. System Resource Management Tracker (SRM.sh)  
- Monitors **CPU, memory, and disk usage**.  
- Helps detect overloads and resource spikes early.  
- Saves usage logs into `srm_logs.txt`.  

### 🔹 3. Automatic Backup System (ABS.sh)  
- Backs up all logs into a **separate folder with timestamps**.  
- Prevents accidental data loss.  
- Keeps backups organized and easy to restore.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charan1911/Shell_Scripting_Basic_Projects.git
   cd Shell_Scripting_Basic_Projects
````

2. **Give execute permissions to scripts**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ULT.sh SRM.sh ABS.sh
   ```

3. **Run scripts manually**

   * Run User Login Tracker:

     ```bash
     ./ULT.sh
     ```

   * Run System Resource Tracker:

     ```bash
     ./SRM.sh
     ```

   * Run Automatic Backup System:

     ```bash
     ./ABS.sh
     ```

## ⏰ Automating with Cron Jobs

You can automate these scripts to run at scheduled times using **cron**.

1. Open the cron editor:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add rules:

   * Run **ABS.sh** every day at 1 AM:

     ```
     0 1 * * * /path/to/ABS.sh
     ```

   * Run **SRM.sh** every hour on the half-hour:

     ```
     30 * * * * /path/to/SRM.sh
     ```

   * Run **ULT.sh** every login session (using PAM or `~/.bashrc`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**
* **Shell Scripting (Bash)**
* **Cron Jobs** (for automation)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* ✅ Add email/SMS alerts if CPU or memory crosses thresholds.
* ✅ Combine all tools into a **single dashboard**.
* ✅ Enable support for **multiple servers** with centralized logging.
* ✅ Add error handling & log rotation features.

## 💡 Key Takeaway

This project shows how **simple shell scripts** can:
✔️ Automate daily repetitive tasks
✔️ Improve system monitoring & reliability
✔️ Act as building blocks for **larger DevOps projects**

Sometimes, the **simplest scripts create the smartest solutions**. 🚀

## 📝 Note

Currently, I have **not added cron job automation** in this repo — all scripts are designed to run manually.
You can extend them by adding your own cron jobs if you want automated execution.
